- Toggle to hide/show file panel

**🤖 Simplified React Agent**  
- Single LangGraph React agent (70% less code than v2.0)
- Natural language understanding in any language
- No manual intent detection or keyword matching
- Automatic tool selection based on user intent
- Context-aware chat (knows current folder and selected files)

**📁 Smart File Management**
- Visual file browser with experiment discovery
- Intelligent experiment organization
- Multi-file selection with Ctrl+Click
- Project root at `data/alice_projects/`

## 📊 System Architecture

```
User Query → LangGraph React Agent → Tool Selection → Response
                    │
                    ├─→ scan_project (list experiments)
                    ├─→ analyze_experiment (analyze folder)
                    ├─→ research_literature (Tavily search)
                    ├─→ optimize_protocol (suggestions)
                    └─→ manage_files (file operations)
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Response Times
- **Simple Queries**: 2-3 seconds (tool selection + execution)
- **Analysis Tasks**: 3-5 seconds (data processing)
- **Deep Research**: 10-30 seconds (Tavily API)
- **File Operations**: <1 second
- **Project Scan**: <2 seconds for 100+ experiments

### API Usage (Deep Research)
- **Queries per research**: 3 (optimized)
- **Research loops**: 1 (optimized)
- **Cost per query**: ~$0.01-0.03
- **Monthly estimate**: <$10 for typical usage

## 📝 Recent Changes

### v2.1.0 (2025-01-12) - Major Refactor
- ✅ **Simplified to single React agent** (removed orchestrators)
- ✅ **Removed all keyword matching** and intent detection
- ✅ **Uses LangGraph's create_react_agent()** 
- ✅ **Natural language understanding** in any language
- ✅ **70% code reduction** from v2.0
- ✅ **Easier to extend** - just add @tool functions
- ✅ **Cleaner architecture** - follows LangGraph best practices

### v2.0.0 (2025-01-08)
- ~~Multi-agent orchestration~~ (replaced in v2.1)
- ~~SmartOrchestrator with 3-tier response~~ (removed)
- ~~4 specialized agents~~ (consolidated to tools)
- Integrated deep research with Tavily API (kept)
- Fixed Explorer path issues

### v1.1.0 (Previous)
- Unified React + chat interface
- Performance: 30x faster (60s → 2-3s)
- Layout: 40/60 split (files/chat)

## 🎯 Immediate Testing

1. **Start System**: 
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend
   uv run uvicorn src.api.app:app --port 8002 --reload
   
   # Terminal 2: Frontend
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open**: http://localhost:5173

3. **Test Examples**:
   - "Hello" - Basic greeting
   - "Scan my experiments" - Lists all experiments
   - "Analyze exp_001_pcr_optimization" - Analyzes specific folder
   - "Help me optimize my PCR" - Gets optimization suggestions
   - "Search literature on GC-rich PCR" - Deep research with Tavily

## 🔧 Adding New Capabilities

With v2.1's simplified architecture, adding new features is easy:

```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def your_new_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Tool description - LLM uses this to know when to call it."""
    return "Tool result"

# Add to tools list in react_agent.py - that's it!
```

## 🔮 Next Phase: v2.2 - Background Processing

**Vision**: Add proactive capabilities while keeping simplicity

**Planned Features**:
- Background monitoring of experiments
- Proactive insights and alerts
- Pattern recognition across experiments
- Scheduled literature updates
- Automated report generation

**Key Principle**: Keep the simple React agent architecture, add capabilities through new tools and background tasks.
