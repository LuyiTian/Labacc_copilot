# LabAcc Copilot - Current Status

*Last Updated: 2025-08-12*

## ✅ v1.1 - Unified Interface (OPERATIONAL)

### What's Working Now

**🎨 Single Integrated Interface**
- React frontend with embedded AI chat (localhost:5173)
- 40% file manager + 60% chat layout (VS Code style)
- Toggle to hide/show file panel

**🤖 AI-Powered Analysis**  
- Context-aware chat (knows current folder and selected files)
- File-based memory system (README files as context)
- Multi-turn conversations with session management
- 2-3 second response times (optimized from 60s)

**📁 Smart File Management**
- Visual file browser with drag-drop upload
- Intelligent experiment organization
- Multi-file selection with Ctrl+Click
- Project root at `data/alice_projects/`

**🔧 Technical Stack**
- Frontend: React + Vite (port 5173)
- Backend: FastAPI with chat bridge (port 8002)  
- AI: LangGraph agents with file-based memory
- Models: Qwen-8B for parsing, Qwen-30B for analysis

### Architecture Diagram
```
React UI (5173) ←→ FastAPI Bridge (8002) ←→ LangGraph Agents
File Manager + Chat   │   API + Chat Bridge   │   AI Processing
Context Sharing       │   Session Management  │   Agent Workflows
```

### Recent Improvements
- **Performance**: 30x faster (60s → 2-3s response time)
- **Layout**: Changed from 70/30 to 40/60 (files/chat)
- **UX**: VS Code style "Hide Files" toggle instead of "Hide Chat"
- **Root**: Fixed to start at project directory, not repo root
- **Integration**: True unified interface, no more separate tabs

## 🚧 Known Limitations

**Current Scope**
- Reactive responses only (user must initiate)
- Single conversation thread
- Limited cross-experiment analysis
- No proactive insights or suggestions
- No background processing or monitoring

**Technical Debt**
- Deep research tool not fully integrated
- Multimodal image analysis incomplete
- No persistent project knowledge
- Limited protocol optimization capabilities

## 🎯 Immediate Testing

1. **Start System**: `npm run dev` + `uvicorn src.api.app:app --port 8002`
2. **Open**: http://localhost:5173
3. **Test Flow**:
   - Browse to experiment folder
   - Select files (Ctrl+Click for multiple)
   - Ask: "What can you tell me about these files?"
   - Upload new data and ask for analysis
   - Test "Hide Files" toggle button

## 🔮 Next Phase: v2.0 - Autonomous Copilot

**Vision**: Transform from reactive assistant → proactive research partner

**Key Differences**:
- **From**: User asks questions → AI responds
- **To**: AI continuously analyzes → surfaces insights automatically

**Planned Capabilities**:
- Project-wide scanning and analysis
- Pattern recognition across experiments  
- Proactive suggestions and warnings
- Background literature research
- Cross-experiment comparison
- Autonomous experiment design recommendations

**Implementation Phases**:
1. Multi-agent architecture with specialized roles
2. Persistent project knowledge system  
3. Background analysis and monitoring
4. Proactive UI with insights dashboard
5. Advanced multimodal and predictive capabilities
