## 📊 System Architecture

```
User Query → Context Builder → React Agent → Tool Selection → Memory Update → Response
                    │                              │
                    ├─ Reads README memories       ├─→ Memory Tools (read, write, search)
                    ├─ Builds rich context         ├─→ Analysis Tools (analyze, diagnose)
                    └─ Adds session state          ├─→ Comparison Tools (compare, insights)
                                                   └─→ Management Tools (create, update)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: User message with optional folder/file context
2. **Context**: Load relevant README memories
3. **Processing**: React agent selects and executes tools
4. **Memory**: Update README with findings
5. **Output**: Response with insights

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Response Times
- **Simple Queries**: 2-3 seconds (tool selection + execution)
- **Analysis Tasks**: 3-5 seconds (data processing)
- **Deep Research**: 10-30 seconds (Tavily API)
- **File Operations**: <1 second
- **Project Scan**: <2 seconds for 100+ experiments

### API Usage (Deep Research)
- **Queries per research**: 3 (optimized)
- **Research loops**: 1 (optimized)
- **Cost per query**: ~$0.01-0.03
- **Monthly estimate**: <$10 for typical usage

## ✅ Recently Fixed Issues (2025-01-14)

### Issues Fixed Today
1. ✅ **Unified Testing Framework**: Separated unit tests (pytest) from agent evaluation (LLM-as-judge)
2. ✅ **Clear Test Separation**: Unit tests for code correctness, agent evaluation for behavior quality
3. ✅ **Real-time Tool Visibility**: Now shows tools as they execute with WebSocket streaming
4. ✅ **README Context Pre-injection**: README content automatically loaded into context
5. ✅ **Smart Context Templates**: Context tailored to query type (optimization vs overview)
6. ✅ **Empty Response Handling**: Proper fallback messages when agent response is empty
7. ✅ **Tool Execution Streaming**: Using `astream_events()` for real-time notifications

### Performance Improvements Achieved

With v2.1's simplified architecture, adding new features is easy:

```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def your_new_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Tool description - LLM uses this to know when to call it."""
    return "Tool result"

# Add to tools list in react_agent.py - that's it!
```

## 📂 Important Data Directories

- **`data/alice_projects/`** - Main experiment storage (production data)
- **`data/bob_projects/`** - Test experiments (may be modified during agent testing)  
- **`data/bob_projects_backup_*/`** - **CRITICAL: Backup of test data**
  - Purpose: Restore test data if corrupted during testing
  - Usage: `cp -r data/bob_projects_backup_*/* data/bob_projects/`
  - DO NOT DELETE these backup directories!

## 🔮 Next Phase: v3.1 - Enhanced Conversion & Real-time Updates

**Vision**: Improve conversion quality and add real-time status updates
