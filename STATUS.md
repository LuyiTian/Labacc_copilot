- 40% file manager + 60% chat layout (VS Code style)
- Toggle to hide/show file panel

**🤖 Multi-Agent Intelligence**  
- Smart orchestrator with 3-tier response system
- Quick mode: <1s pattern-matched responses
- Deep mode: 10-30s literature search
- Context-aware chat (knows current folder and selected files)
- Project scanning finds all experiments automatically

**📁 Smart File Management**
- Visual file browser with experiment discovery
- Intelligent experiment organization
- Multi-file selection with Ctrl+Click
- Project root at `data/alice_projects/`

## 📊 System Architecture

```
User Query → Smart Orchestrator → Response Mode Selection
    ├─→ Quick Mode (<1s)
    │     └─→ Pattern matching, no LLM
    │
    └─→ Deep Mode (10-30s)
          ├─→ Explorer: Scans projects
          ├─→ Analyzer: Protocol analysis
          ├─→ Researcher: Tavily API
          └─→ Advisor: Optimizations
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Response Times
- **Quick Mode**: <1 second (pattern matching)
- **Smart Mode**: 2-5 seconds (selective LLM)
- **Deep Research**: 10-30 seconds (3 queries, 1 loop)
- **File Operations**: <100ms
- **Project Scan**: <1s for 100+ experiments

### API Usage (Deep Research)
- **Queries per research**: 3 (reduced from 10)
- **Research loops**: 1 (reduced from 2)
- **Cost per query**: ~$0.01-0.03
- **Monthly estimate**: <$10 for typical usage

## 📝 Recent Changes

### v2.0.0 (2025-01-08)
- ✅ Implemented multi-agent orchestration
- ✅ Added SmartOrchestrator with 3-tier response
- ✅ Integrated deep research with Tavily API
- ✅ Created 4 specialized agents
- ✅ Reduced research parameters (70% faster)
- ✅ Fixed Explorer path issues
- ✅ Updated all documentation

### v1.1.0 (Previous)
- Unified React + chat interface
- Performance: 30x faster (60s → 2-3s)
- Layout: 40/60 split (files/chat)
- Fixed project root path
- Limited cross-experiment analysis
- No proactive insights or suggestions
- No background processing or monitoring

**Technical Debt**
- Deep research tool not fully integrated
- Multimodal image analysis incomplete
- No persistent project knowledge
- Limited protocol optimization capabilities

## 🎯 Immediate Testing

1. **Start System**: `npm run dev` + `uvicorn src.api.app:app --port 8002`
2. **Open**: http://localhost:5173
3. **Test Flow**:
   - Browse to experiment folder
   - Select files (Ctrl+Click for multiple)
   - Ask: "What can you tell me about these files?"
   - Upload new data and ask for analysis
   - Test "Hide Files" toggle button

## 🔮 Next Phase: v2.0 - Autonomous Copilot

**Vision**: Transform from reactive assistant → proactive research partner

**Key Differences**:
- **From**: User asks questions → AI responds
- **To**: AI continuously analyzes → surfaces insights automatically

**Planned Capabilities**:
- Project-wide scanning and analysis
- Pattern recognition across experiments  
- Proactive suggestions and warnings
- Background literature research
- Cross-experiment comparison
- Autonomous experiment design recommendations

**Implementation Phases**:
1. Multi-agent architecture with specialized roles
2. Persistent project knowledge system  
3. Background analysis and monitoring
4. Proactive UI with insights dashboard
5. Advanced multimodal and predictive capabilities
