**ID:** exp_003_exp_002_optimized_dissociation

## Overview

**Motivation:** Improve recovery and viability of tumor epithelial cells from lung adenocarcinoma tissue by optimizing dissociation protocol, based on issues identified in exp_001
**Key Question:** Can a reduced-time, hybrid cold‑warm digestion with enhanced mechanical disruption and debris removal increase tumor epithelial cell capture and reduce mitochondrial stress in 10X scRNA‑seq of lung adenocarcinoma?
**Hypothesis:** Initial hypothesis
