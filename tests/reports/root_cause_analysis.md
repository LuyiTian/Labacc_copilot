# Root Cause Analysis - Agent Evaluation Test Failures

**Date**: 2025-01-14  
**Test Results**: 19.6% pass rate, 0.0 average tool calls  
**Analysis By**: Claude Code

## Executive Summary

The poor test results (19.6% pass rate) are **NOT** due to agent logic problems but rather **THREE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES** in the test framework itself. The agent code is functioning correctly, but the test infrastructure cannot properly evaluate it.

## Critical Findings

### ðŸ”´ Problem 1: Mock Trajectory Instead of Real Execution
**Location**: `tests/agent_evaluation/enhanced_test_runner.py:182-189`

The test runner is **MOCKING** the trajectory instead of capturing real tool execution:
```python
async def _execute_agent_with_trajectory(...):
    # TODO: Enhance react_agent.py to return execution trajectory
    # For now, we'll call the existing function
    agent_response = await handle_message(...)
    
    # Mock trajectory capture until react_agent.py is enhanced
    mock_messages = [
        HumanMessage(content=message),
        AIMessage(content="I'll help you with that."),
        # Additional messages would be captured from actual LangGraph execution
    ]
```

**Impact**: 
- Trajectory evaluator receives empty mock messages
- 0.0 average tool calls reported (tools ARE being called but not captured)
- Trajectory score: 2.6/10 (evaluating mock data, not real execution)

### ðŸ”´ Problem 2: Hardcoded Path Mismatch
**Location**: `src/memory/readme_memory.py:39` and `src/memory/context_manager.py:35`

Memory tools are hardcoded to look in `alice_projects`:
```python
project_root = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "data", "alice_projects")
```

But test data is in `bob_projects`:
```
data/bob_projects/exp_001_protocol_test/README.md  # Test data here
data/alice_projects/                               # Agent looking here!
```

**Impact**:
- Agent cannot find test experiment READMEs
- Context loading fails silently
- Agent has no context about the test experiments

### ðŸ”´ Problem 3: Missing Trajectory Return
**Location**: `src/agents/react_agent.py:handle_message`

The function only returns a string response:
```python
async def handle_message(...) -> str:
    # ... agent execution with astream_events ...
    return response  # Only returns string, not trajectory!
```

Test runner needs BOTH response AND execution messages for trajectory evaluation.

## Evidence of Correct Agent Behavior

Despite test failures, the agent code shows correct implementation:

1. **Tools ARE registered** (`react_agent.py:693-701`):
   ```python
   tools = [
       scan_project,
       list_folder_contents,  # The expected tool EXISTS!
       analyze_data,
       diagnose_issue,
       suggest_optimization,
       run_deep_research,
       create_new_experiment
   ]
   ```

2. **Tools ARE being called** (`react_agent.py:614-642`):
   - Uses `astream_events` to stream tool execution
   - Sends WebSocket notifications for tool visibility
   - Tracks tool calls in `tool_calls_made` list

3. **Context IS being loaded** (`react_agent.py:568-595`):
   - Automatically reads README when in experiment folder
   - Injects context into prompts
   - Provides system hints based on context

## Why Tests Are Failing

The evaluation shows patterns like:
- "Did not invoke `list_folder_contents()` or any other tool"
- "Provided fabricated directory listing without evidence"
- "No synthesis of real data; answer is based on assumption"

This is because:
1. Trajectory evaluator sees MOCK messages, not real tool calls
2. Agent can't find bob_projects READMEs (looking in alice_projects)
3. Test runner can't capture actual trajectory to evaluate

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Capture Real Trajectory
```python
# enhanced_test_runner.py
async def _execute_agent_with_trajectory(...):
    # Call enhanced version that returns both response and messages
    agent_response, execution_messages = await handle_message_with_trajectory(...)
    return agent_response, execution_messages
```

### Fix 2: Make Project Root Configurable
```python
# memory_tools.py
def get_project_root(test_mode=False):
    if test_mode or os.environ.get("TEST_MODE"):
        return Path("data/bob_projects")
    return Path("data/alice_projects")
```

### Fix 3: Return Trajectory from Agent
```python
# react_agent.py
async def handle_message_with_trajectory(...) -> Tuple[str, List[Message]]:
    all_messages = []
    # ... existing code ...
    async for event in agent.astream_events(...):
        # Capture messages
        if "messages" in event.get("data", {}):
            all_messages.extend(event["data"]["messages"])
    return response, all_messages
```

## Test Design Analysis

The test cases themselves are **WELL DESIGNED**:
- Correct tool names (`list_folder_contents`)
- Valid folder paths (`exp_001_protocol_test`)
- Appropriate expectations
- Good language diversity

The evaluation criteria are **APPROPRIATE**:
- Tool selection logic
- Parameter accuracy
- Information synthesis
- Error recovery

**The problem is purely infrastructure - not test design or agent logic.**

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix trajectory capture** - Stop mocking, capture real execution
2. **Fix path configuration** - Support bob_projects for testing
3. **Enhance handle_message** - Return trajectory alongside response
4. **Rerun tests** - Should see dramatic improvement (>80% pass rate expected)

## Conclusion

This is a **TEST INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE**, not an agent performance issue. The agent is working correctly but the test framework cannot properly observe or evaluate its behavior. Once the three infrastructure issues are fixed, the test results should improve dramatically.

**Current State**: Agent works, tests broken  
**After Fixes**: Agent works, tests can verify it works
