Implementing the above optimizations should markedly improve epithelial recovery, viability, and overall data quality for the upcoming **exp_002**.",

Initial cold digestion** | 15\u202fmin at 4\u202f\u00b0C with 0.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f kit enzyme (partial dissociation) | Reduces protease activity on delicate epithelial membranes; keeps stress low (mito %). |\n| **2. Warm digestion** | 15\u201120\u202fmin at 37\u202f\u00b0C (instead of 45\u202fmin) | Shortens exposure to harsh conditions; still enough to break residual matrix. |\n| **3. Mechanical disruption** | Add **2 extra gentleMACS cycles** (total 5) at \u201cmedium\u2011high\u201d speed, then a brief 1\u2011min vortex with 5\u202f\u00b5L 0.04\u202f% BSA | Improves breakup of clumps without over\u2011shearing; extra cycles compensate for the shorter enzymatic step. |\n| **4. Debris removal** | **DNase I (1\u202fU\u202f\u00b5L\u207b\u00b9)** added after digestion, 5\u202fmin on ice; then run the **Debris Removal Kit** (magnetic beads) before filtration | Removes extracellular DNA from lysed cells, cuts ambient RNA background, and clears remaining collagen/fibrillar debris. |\n| **5. Filtration** | Sequential 70\u202f\u00b5m \u2192 40\u202f\u00b5m \u2192 **30\u202f\u00b5m** filter (instead of a single 40\u202f\u00b5m) | Captures any remaining large clumps early, then yields a true single\u2011cell suspension for 10X. |\n| **6. Real\u2011time QC** | Every 5\u202fmin: count cells with Trypan Blue, assess % clumps under microscope, and measure mito % on a quick 10X pilot run (\u22485\u202f\u00b5L) | Allows you to stop the digestion the moment viability starts to drop or clumps still persist. |\n| **7. Final concentration** | Aim for **1\u202f200 cells\u202f\u00b5L\u207b\u00b9** (instead of 1\u202f000) to load ~55\u202f\u00b5L \u2192 ~55\u202f000 cells, giving a safety margin for loss while still targeting ~5\u202f000 recovered cells. |\n\n### Expected impact\n\n| Metric | Current (exp\u202f001) | Target (exp\u202f002) |\n|--------|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Viability** | 76\u202f% | \u2265\u202f85\u202f% |\n| **Mito %** | 16.8\u202f% | \u2264\u202f13\u202f% |\n| **Tumor epithelial recovery** | 8\u202f% | 25\u201135\u202f% |\n| **Immune bias** | 65\u202f% | 30\u201145\u202f% |\n| **Median genes/cell** | 1\u202f247 | \u2265\u202f1\u202f500 |\n| **Fibroblast capture** | 6.5\u202f% | 10\u201115\u202f% |\n\n---\n\n## Immediate next steps\n\n1. **Order reagents** \u2013 cold\u2011digestion buffer (4\u202f\u00b0C PBS + 0.04\u202f% BSA), DNase I, Debris Removal Kit.  \n2. **Update the SOP** (Standard Operating Procedure) with the step\u2011by\u2011step timing table above.  \n3. **Pilot test** \u2013 run a small\u2011scale (\u224810\u202f% of the planned tissue) using the new workflow; collect a quick 10X \u201cmini\u2011run\u201d to verify viability and mito % before scaling up.  \n4. **Document** \u2013 keep a live log (CSV) of time\u2011point cell counts, % clumps, and viability; this will let you fine\u2011tune the exact 15\u201120\u202fmin warm window for future samples.  \n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\n- **Problem**: Over\u2011digestion + insufficient mechanical dissociation \u2192 loss of fragile tumor epithelial cells, high stress (mito), immune bias.  \n- **Fix**: Shorter warm digestion, add a cold pre\u2011digestion, boost mechanical cycles, include DNase & debris removal, filter more finely, and monitor viability in real time.  \n- **Goal for exp\u202f002**: \u2265\u202f85\u202f% viability, \u2264\u202f13\u202f% mito, \u2265\u202f25\u202f% epithelial recovery, and a balanced immune\u2011stromal composition.\n\nIf you\u2019d like a concrete **lab\u2011protocol PDF** or a **run\u2011list for the 10X Cell Ranger** with the new expected cell numbers, just let me know and I\u2019ll generate it for you.",
