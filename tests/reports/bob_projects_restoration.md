# Bob Projects Test Data Restoration System

**Date**: 2025-01-14  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED  

## Summary

Successfully implemented automatic restoration of `bob_projects` test data from backup to prevent test-induced modifications from persisting.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backup Location
- **Path**: `/data/luyit/script/git/Labacc_copilot/data/bob_projects_backup_20250813_174456`
- **Status**: Preserved and protected
- **Contents**: Original test data for experiments

### 2. Restoration Points

#### A. Test Runner Initialization
**File**: `tests/agent_evaluation/enhanced_test_runner.py`
```python
def __init__(self):
    # Set TEST_MODE for bob_projects access
    os.environ["TEST_MODE"] = "true"
    
    # Restore bob_projects from backup before tests
    self._restore_bob_projects()
```

#### B. Test Completion
**File**: `tests/agent_evaluation/enhanced_test_runner.py`
```python
async def run_comprehensive_evaluation():
    # ... run tests ...
    
    # Restore bob_projects after all tests complete
    self._restore_bob_projects()
    print("✅ Restored bob_projects to clean state after evaluation")
```

#### C. Evaluation Script
**File**: `run_evaluation.py`
```python
async def main():
    # Set TEST_MODE environment variable for bob_projects access
    os.environ["TEST_MODE"] = "true"
```

### 3. Existing Pytest Fixtures
**File**: `tests/conftest.py`

Already provides comprehensive restoration fixtures:
- `restore_bob_projects`: Session-level restoration
- `reset_bob_projects`: Function-level restoration
- `bob_projects_path`: Path provider with auto-restore

## Verification Results

### Restoration Test Output
```
✅ bob_projects is already in clean state!
✅ Restoration successful - hashes match!
✅ TEST_MODE correctly routes to bob_projects
✅ bob_projects remains in clean state
✅ All restoration tests passed!
```

### Key Verification Points
1. **Hash Verification**: MD5 hash confirms exact restoration
2. **TEST_MODE Routing**: Memory tools correctly use bob_projects
3. **Automatic Restoration**: Happens at test start and end
4. **No Manual Intervention**: Fully automated process

## Usage

### For Developers
```bash
# Simply run evaluation - restoration is automatic
python run_evaluation.py --full

# Or run specific tests
uv run pytest tests/agent_evaluation/
```

### For Test Writers
```python
# Use the fixtures for isolated tests
def test_something(reset_bob_projects):
    # bob_projects is clean at start
    # ... modify bob_projects ...
    # bob_projects is restored after test
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Test data always starts clean
2. **Reproducibility**: Tests run on identical data
3. **No Accumulation**: Changes don't persist between runs
4. **Automatic**: No manual restoration needed
5. **Fast**: Simple file copy operation

## Protection Mechanisms

### Multiple Layers
1. **Before Tests**: Restore from backup
2. **After Tests**: Restore from backup
3. **TEST_MODE**: Routes to bob_projects (not alice_projects)
4. **Fixtures**: Additional restoration options

### Safeguards
- Backup directory is never modified
- alice_projects is never touched
- Restoration verified by hash comparison
- Clear console output confirms restoration

## Files Modified

1. `tests/agent_evaluation/enhanced_test_runner.py`
   - Added `_restore_bob_projects()` method
   - Restoration at init and completion

2. `run_evaluation.py`
   - Sets TEST_MODE environment variable

3. `test_restoration.py` (new)
   - Verification script for restoration

4. `tests/conftest.py` (existing)
   - Already had restoration fixtures

## Testing Tools Created

### test_restoration.py
- Verifies restoration works correctly
- Checks MD5 hashes match
- Tests TEST_MODE routing
- Confirms data integrity

## Conclusion

The bob_projects test data is now fully protected with automatic restoration at multiple points. Tests can freely modify the data knowing it will be restored to the original state, ensuring reproducible and reliable test results.
