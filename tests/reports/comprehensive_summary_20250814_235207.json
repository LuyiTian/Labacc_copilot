  "critical_issues": [
    "Speculative file content descriptions were provided without first reading the actual file contents.",
    "Duplicate logging of the same `list_folder_contents` result adds unnecessary redundancy.",
    "Duplicate display of the tool result in the transcript, which indicates a minor redundancy.",
    "Mention of subfolders (cellranger_count, microscopy_images) that were not confirmed by the tool output, introducing unverified information.",
    "Duplicate logging of the list_folder_contents result (Step\u202f2 and Step\u202f3) \u2013 harmless but unnecessary.",
    "Redundant logging of the same `list_folder_contents` result (steps 2 and 3).",
    "File descriptions were added without explicit evidence from the tool output, which could mislead if the content differs.",
    "Used `list_folder_contents` instead of a direct file\u2011reading tool, risking incomplete or inaccurate content retrieval.",
    "Redundant second call to `list_folder_contents` adds unnecessary steps.",
    "No tool usage to fetch real experiment files (risk of hallucination)."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "If detailed file content is required, follow up the folder listing with a `read_file` or similar tool to extract and verify key information before summarizing.",
    "Avoid logging duplicate tool results; ensure each tool call is recorded only once.",
    "When inferring file purpose, qualify statements (e.g., \"likely contains\" or \"appears to be\") unless the content has been explicitly inspected.",
    "Avoid repeating the same tool result in the execution log; ensure each step adds new information.",
    "If subfolders are to be reported, explicitly verify their existence using the same `list_folder_contents` call or a separate check, or qualify the statement with uncertainty (e.g., \"may contain\").",
    "Maintain the clear, tabular presentation style for future folder\u2011listing queries.",
    "Streamline logging to avoid repeating identical tool results.",
    "Maintain the current practice of presenting file information in a clear table format.",
    "Avoid duplicate handling of the same tool output; process it once and move to the next step.",
    "Base any descriptive annotations on actual file content (e.g., by opening a file with `read_file` if needed) or clearly state that the description is an assumption."
