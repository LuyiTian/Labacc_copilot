# README Memory System Specification v2.0

## Executive Summary

This specification defines a **README-based memory system** for LabAcc Copilot where each experiment folder maintains its knowledge in a structured README file. This approach uses **SOTA LLM reasoning** instead of pattern matching, providing intelligent, adaptive analysis for any experiment type.

**Core Principle**: README.md is the single source of truth and memory for each experiment folder.

**Status**: Specification Complete  
**Version**: 2.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-13  
**Author**: LabAcc Development Team

## Design Philosophy

### Why README as Memory?

1. **Human-Readable**: Scientists can read and edit directly
2. **Version Controlled**: Git tracks all changes automatically
3. **Transparent**: No black box - all reasoning is visible
4. **LLM-Native**: Markdown is perfectly understood by LLMs
5. **No Dependencies**: No vector DB, no embeddings needed
6. **Portable**: Works anywhere, no special infrastructure

### SOTA Approach vs Pattern Matching

❌ **Old Way (Pattern Matching)**:
```python
if "no bands" in result:
    return "Check primers"  # Rigid, limited
```

✅ **New Way (SOTA LLM Reasoning)**:
```python
context = read_readme(experiment_folder)
analysis = llm.reason_about(context, current_issue)
# LLM uses its full training knowledge to provide insights
```

## README Structure Specification

### Standard README Template

```markdown
# Experiment: [Experiment Name]
*Last Updated: [ISO Timestamp] by [Agent/Human]*
*Folder ID: exp_[number]_[descriptive_name]*

## 🧪 Experimental Design

### Variables Tested
- **Independent Variable**: Annealing temperature (50-70°C, 2°C increments)
- **Dependent Variable**: Amplification efficiency (Ct values)
- **Controls**: 
  - Positive: Known template at 100ng
  - Negative: No template control (NTC)
- **Constants**: 
  - Primer concentration: 0.5μM
  - Mg2+ concentration: 2.5mM
  - Polymerase: Q5 High-Fidelity

### Sample Size & Replicates
- N = 96 (8 temperatures × 12 replicates)
- Technical replicates: 3
- Biological replicates: 4

---

## 📊 Results

### Key Findings
1. **Optimal annealing temperature**: 62°C (Ct = 22.3 ± 0.5)
2. **Temperature sensitivity**: Sharp drop in efficiency below 58°C
3. **Specificity**: Single band observed at 62-66°C range
4. **Yield**: 450ng/μL at optimal conditions

### Statistical Summary
```
Mean Ct at 62°C: 22.3
Standard Deviation: 0.5
Coefficient of Variation: 2.2%
P-value (ANOVA): <0.001
Effect size (η²): 0.78
```

### Unexpected Observations
- Secondary band at 68°C (possible primer dimer)
- Enhanced amplification with 5% DMSO addition

---

## 🔬 Methods

### Protocol Summary
Standard PCR using Q5 polymerase with gradient optimization. 35 cycles with 30s extension time. Full protocol in `protocol.pdf`.

### Key Parameters
```yaml
Initial_Denaturation: 98°C for 30s
Denaturation: 98°C for 10s
Annealing: Variable (50-70°C) for 30s
Extension: 72°C for 30s
Final_Extension: 72°C for 2min
Cycles: 35
```

## 💡 AI Insights

### Analysis (Generated: 2025-01-13 14:30)
Based on the data pattern, this appears to be a well-optimized PCR with good reproducibility. The sharp efficiency drop below 58°C suggests primer-template mismatch issues at lower temperatures. The CV of 2.2% indicates excellent technical consistency.

### Recommendations
1. **For routine use**: Set annealing at 62°C with 30s duration
2. **For difficult templates**: Consider adding 3-5% DMSO
3. **Quality control**: Include melt curve analysis to verify specificity

### Comparison with Previous Experiments
- Improvement over exp_002: 15% better efficiency
- Similar optimal temperature to exp_005 (61°C)
- Better reproducibility than all previous attempts

## 📝 Notes & Observations

### Troubleshooting Log

- [ ] Implement `analyze_folder` tool
- [ ] Create README template generator
- [ ] Test with sample experiments

- [ ] Implement `ask_experiment` for SOTA reasoning
- [ ] Implement `compare_experiments` 
- [ ] Implement `generate_summary`
- [ ] Remove ALL pattern matching code
- [ ] Test LLM reasoning accuracy

### Phase 3: Automation (Week 3)

- [ ] Test automatic README updates
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Data File Added
```python
# User adds "pcr_results_day3.csv" to experiment folder

# System automatically:
1. Detects new file
2. Analyzes with LLM: "PCR results showing Ct values for 96 samples"
3. Updates README Files section
4. Extracts key results: "Mean Ct: 23.5, Best sample: A1"
5. Updates Results section
6. Adds to change history
```

### Scenario 2: Experiment Failure Diagnosis
```python
# User: "Why did my PCR fail?"

# System:
1. Reads experiment README
2. Analyzes recent data files
3. Uses LLM reasoning (NOT patterns):
   "Based on your Ct values all being >35 and the negative control 
    showing amplification, this suggests contamination rather than 
    primer issues. The timing of the contamination appearance 
    suggests it occurred during template preparation."
4. No hardcoded patterns used!
```

### Scenario 3: Cross-Experiment Learning
```python
# User: "Compare all my PCR experiments"

# System:
1. Reads all PCR experiment READMEs
2. Extracts key parameters and results
3. LLM identifies patterns:
   "Experiments with annealing at 60-62°C consistently succeeded.
    DMSO addition helped in 3/4 GC-rich templates.
    Tuesday experiments mysteriously fail more often (equipment issue?)"
4. Updates project-level insights
```

## Success Metrics

### Memory Quality
- README completeness: >90% of files documented
- Update latency: <5 seconds after file change
