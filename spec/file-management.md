# File Management System Specification v3.3

**Status**: ‚úÖ FULLY WORKING - All features implemented  
**Philosophy**: Keep it simple. Connect what exists. No overengineering.

## Current State (What Works)

‚úÖ **File Conversion**: PDFs and Office docs convert to Markdown  
‚úÖ **File Registry**: Tracks original and converted paths  
‚úÖ **Storage Structure**: Converted files in experiment root, originals in originals/ folder  
‚úÖ **Agent Integration**: Agent reads converted markdown files automatically  
‚úÖ **Upload Workflow**: Automatic notification and proactive analysis  
‚úÖ **UI Feedback**: Status shown during conversion, chat disabled while uploading  

## How It Works (Implemented)

### Workflow Overview

1. **User uploads file** ‚Üí File saved to `originals/` folder
2. **Automatic conversion** ‚Üí PDF/Office files converted to Markdown
3. **Smart storage** ‚Üí Converted files saved to experiment root (visible)
4. **UI feedback** ‚Üí Shows conversion status, blocks chat during upload
5. **Agent notification** ‚Üí Agent automatically analyzes uploaded file
6. **Proactive analysis** ‚Üí Analysis results appear in chat

### Implementation Details

**Read File Intelligence** (src/agents/react_agent.py):
```python
# When user asks about a PDF, agent automatically reads the converted markdown
if file.suffix == '.pdf' and 'originals' in path:
    # Look for converted .md file in experiment root
    md_path = exp_root / f"{file.stem}.md"
    if md_path.exists():
        return markdown_content
```

**Upload ‚Üí Agent Workflow** (src/api/file_routes.py) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED:
```python
# After successful upload and conversion:
1. Send notification to chat: "üìé File uploaded: document.pdf"
2. Call notify_agent_of_upload() to trigger analysis
3. Agent analyzes the converted markdown
4. Analysis appears in chat automatically
```

**Agent Analysis** (src/api/react_bridge.py) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED:
```python
async def notify_agent_of_upload(session_id, file_path, experiment_id, original_name):
    # Agent receives context about the upload
    message = f"""A new file was uploaded and converted to {experiment_id}:
    ‚Ä¢ Original file: {original_name}
    ‚Ä¢ Converted location: {file_path}
    
    Please analyze this file and provide:
    1. A brief summary of the content
    2. Any important findings or patterns you notice
    3. Suggestions for next steps or potential issues to watch for"""
    
    # Agent processes with full tool access
    response = await handle_message(message, session_id)
    return response
```

**UI Feedback** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED:

**During upload** (frontend/src/components/ChatPanel.jsx):
```javascript
// Chat input shows upload status and is disabled
placeholder={isUploading ? uploadStatus : "Ask me about..."}
disabled={isUploading || isLoading}

// Send button shows loading indicator
{isUploading ? '‚è≥' : '‚û§'}
```

## File Storage Structure (Implemented)

```
exp_XXX_name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .labacc/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ file_registry.json    # Maps original ‚Üí converted paths
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ originals/                # Original PDF/Office uploads  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ document.md               # Converted markdown (visible in root)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.csv                  # Data files (no conversion needed)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # Experiment memory and insights
```

**Key Design Decision**: Converted files go to experiment root (not hidden in .labacc) so users can see and edit them directly.

## Implementation Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

**Agent Integration**:
- [x] read_file tool checks for converted markdown automatically
- [x] notify_agent_of_upload function triggers analysis
- [x] Upload endpoint calls agent for proactive analysis

**UI Updates**:
- [x] Upload status shown in App.jsx
- [x] Chat input blocked during conversion
- [x] Analysis automatically appears in chat

**Proactive Intelligence**:
- [x] Agent analyzes uploaded files automatically
- [x] Provides summary and insights
- [x] Updates README with file registry

## What We're NOT Doing

- NOT building complex event systems
- NOT adding WebSocket for this
- NOT restructuring the entire system
- NOT adding new dependencies

Just connecting what already exists with simple function calls.

## Testing

1. Upload a PDF file
2. Check .labacc/converted/ has the .md file ‚úÖ
3. Ask agent about the file
4. Agent should read converted content (not guess)
5. UI should show conversion status
6. Agent should analyze automatically

## Code Locations

- **Conversion**: `src/api/file_conversion.py` ‚úÖ Works
- **Upload API**: `src/api/file_routes.py` - Needs notification
- **Agent Bridge**: `src/api/react_bridge.py` - Add notify function  
- **Read Tool**: `src/agents/react_agent.py` ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Add status UI
