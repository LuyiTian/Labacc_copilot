# Experiments Directory

This directory contains all experimental data and context organized by individual experiments.

## Directory Structure

Each experiment should follow this naming convention: `exp_XXX_descriptive_name/`

- `XXX` = 3-digit sequence number (001, 002, etc.)
- `descriptive_name` = brief description using underscores

## Current Experiments

*No experiments currently recorded. Each experiment added will be listed here with status.*

## Experiment Folder Template

When creating a new experiment folder, include:

- `README.md` - Experiment summary and context (required)
- `data.csv` or similar - Raw experimental data
- `images/` - Experimental images, gels, plots
- `analysis/` - Analysis scripts and results
- `protocols/` - Specific protocols used (if different from standard)

## Status Codes

- **Planning**: Experiment design in progress
- **In Progress**: Currently running experiment
- **Completed**: Experiment finished successfully
- **Failed**: Experiment failed or discontinued
- **On Hold**: Temporarily paused

## Notes

- Always update this README when adding new experiments
- Link to decision history when AI assistance was used
- Include brief status summary for each experiment
