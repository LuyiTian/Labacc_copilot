**Operator**: Bob Chen, Jennifer Liu  
**Status**: **COMPLETED** ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues identified

**Objective**: Test standard 10X scRNAseq protocol on lung adenocarcinoma tissue to establish baseline protocol and identify potential issues.

## Experiment Design

## Results

### Cell Recovery & Viability
- **Total cells recovered**: 47,500 cells

- **Final loaded cells**: 5,200 cells
- **Cells recovered after 10X**: 3,847 cells
- **Capture efficiency**: 74%

### Cell Type Composition (Preliminary Clustering)
**PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**: Severe bias toward immune cells

| Cell Type | Expected % | Observed % | Cells Captured |
|-----------|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Tumor Epithelial** | 25-40% | **8.2%** ‚ö†Ô∏è | 315 cells |
| **T Cells** | 15-20% | **34.1%** ‚Üë | 1,312 cells |
| **Macrophages** | 8-12% | **18.7%** ‚Üë | 719 cells |
| **NK Cells** | 2-5% | **7.8%** ‚Üë | 300 cells |
| **B Cells** | 1-3% | **4.2%** ‚Üë | 162 cells |
| **Fibroblasts** | 10-15% | **6.5%** ‚Üì | 250 cells |
| **Endothelial** | 3-8% | **2.8%** | 108 cells |
| **Other/Unknown** | 5-10% | **17.7%** | 681 cells |

### Quality Metrics
- **Median genes/cell**: 1,247 (below target of 1,500)
- **Median UMI/cell**: 2,856
- **Mitochondrial %**: 16.8% ‚ö†Ô∏è (above target of <15%)
- **Doublet rate**: 8.4% ‚úÖ (within target)

### Key Observations

#### üî¥ Critical Issues:
1. **Severe tumor epithelial cell loss**: Only 8% vs expected 25-40%
2. **Immune cell enrichment**: 65% total immune vs expected 25-35%  
3. **High mitochondrial gene %**: Indicating cell stress/damage
4. **Cell clumps observed during processing**: Incomplete dissociation

#### üìä Technical Notes:
- Many epithelial-like clusters were visible after 30min digestion
- Extended digestion to 45min to break up clumps
- Final suspension had significant debris
- Live/dead staining showed fragmented cells

## Root Cause Analysis

### Likely Issues:
1. **Over-digestion of fragile tumor epithelial cells**
   - 45min at 37¬∞C too harsh for lung adenocarcinoma epithelium
   - Warm digestion induced stress response (high mito %)
   - Epithelial cells lysed while resistant immune cells survived

2. **Incomplete mechanical dissociation**  
   - Cell clumps still present after gentleMACS
   - Stromal matrix not fully disrupted
   - Under-representation of fibroblasts suggests trapped cells

3. **High ambient RNA contamination**
   - Lysed cells released RNA into supernatant
   - May explain high "Other/Unknown" cell percentage

## Recommendations for exp_002

### Primary Changes:
1. **Reduce digestion time**: 25-30 minutes instead of 45 min
2. **Implement cold digestion**: 4¬∞C partial digestion to reduce stress
3. **Enhanced mechanical disruption**: Additional gentleMACS cycles
4. **Debris removal**: Add DNase treatment and debris removal kit
5. **Real-time monitoring**: Check dissociation every 10-15 minutes

### Protocol Optimization:
- Start with 15min cold digestion (4¬∞C) 
- Continue with 15-20min warm digestion (37¬∞C)
- Monitor cell release and viability throughout
- Stop immediately when single-cell suspension achieved

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Completed**: Data analysis and issue identification  
2. üîÑ **In Progress**: Literature review for lung tumor dissociation  
3. ‚è≥ **Planned**: Design exp_002 optimization protocol
4. ‚è≥ **Planned**: Order cold digestion reagents and debris removal kit

## Lessons Learned

> **Key Insight**: Lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells are extremely fragile compared to immune cells. Standard "one-size-fits-all" tumor dissociation protocols may not preserve the cellular diversity needed for meaningful analysis.

**For next experiment**: Focus on gentle, time-optimized dissociation with real-time monitoring rather than fixed protocol timing.
