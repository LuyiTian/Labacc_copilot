# T-cell_exhaustion_aging_study

## Research Question
Age-related T-cell exhaustion is characterized by increased PD-1 
  expression and decreased cytokine production, and can be partially 
  reversed by checkpoint inhibitor treatment in aged mouse models

## Hypothesis
Age-related T-cell exhaustion is characterized by increased PD-1 
  expression and decreased cytokine production, and can be partially 
  reversed by checkpoint inhibitor treatment in aged mouse models

## Planned Experiments
