DISSOCIATION PROTOCOL NOTES - EXP_001
Date: 2025-01-15
Operator: Bob Chen, Jennifer Liu
Sample: LC-001 Primary lung adenocarcinoma

=== TIMELINE AND OBSERVATIONS ===

09:30 - Sample received from OR
- Fresh surgical specimen on ice
- Pathologist confirmed ~75% tumor content
- Tissue weight: 2.4g (good size for protocol)

09:45 - Initial tissue prep
- Cut into 2-3mm pieces with scalpel
- Tumor tissue appears somewhat necrotic in center
- Relatively soft texture, not highly fibrotic

10:00 - Start gentleMACS mechanical dissociation
- Program: "medium_01" (37C_m_TDK_1)
- Tissue pieces break up well initially
- Some larger chunks remain visible

10:15 - First enzymatic step (15 min mark)
- Added Enzyme D, R, A mix per protocol
- Incubating at 37°C with gentle shaking
- Sample looks cloudy, good cell release

10:30 - Checked under microscope (30 min mark)
- MANY single cells visible - good!  
- BUT: still seeing larger cell clumps (likely epithelial sheets)
- Suspension has mix of small round cells and larger irregular cells
- Decision: Continue digestion to break up remaining clumps

10:45 - Second gentleMACS cycle
- Program: "medium_02" 
- More clumps breaking up but some persist
- Suspension getting more turbid

11:00 - Final time point check (45 min total)
- Much better single cell suspension
- Still some small clumps but acceptable for straining
- Lots of debris visible (concerning)

11:15 - Straining and cleanup
- 70μm strain: caught significant clumps and debris
- 40μm strain: minimal additional filtering needed
- Final volume: ~15mL

11:30 - Cell counting
- Trypan blue viability: 76% (lower than hoped)
- Many cells appear "stressed" - swollen, granular
- High debris background making counting difficult

12:00 - 10X loading preparation  
- Diluted to 1000 cells/μL
- Loaded 50μL (targeting ~5000 recovered cells)

=== KEY OBSERVATIONS ===

POSITIVE:
+ Good mechanical breakdown of tissue
+ Achieved single-cell suspension eventually
+ Reasonable cell recovery numbers

CONCERNING:
- Took full 45 minutes to break up epithelial clumps
- High debris level suggests over-digestion
- Cell viability lower than target (76% vs >80%)
- Many cells looked "stressed" under microscope

LARGE CELL CLUMPS (likely epithelial):
- Initially formed tight sheets resistant to gentle dissociation
- Required extended digestion time to release
- By 45min, many appeared fragmented with cellular debris
- NOTE: Only learned these were epithelial after scRNAseq analysis

SMALL ROUND CELLS:
- Released easily and early in digestion
- Appeared healthy and intact throughout process  
- NOTE: Later scRNAseq revealed these were mostly immune cells

=== IMMEDIATE PROTOCOL CONCERNS ===

1. OVER-DIGESTION SUSPECTED:
- 45min at 37°C may be too harsh
- High debris suggests cell lysis
- Low viability supports this hypothesis

2. EPITHELIAL FRAGILITY:
- Lung adenocarcinoma epithelium very sensitive
- Standard tumor protocol may be too aggressive
- Need gentler approach for these cells

3. INCOMPLETE MECHANICAL DISRUPTION:
- Clumps persisted through standard gentleMACS
- May need additional or modified mechanical steps
- Clumps trap cells and bias composition

=== RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT EXPERIMENT ===

IMMEDIATE CHANGES:
1. Reduce digestion time: Try 25-30 minutes maximum
2. Consider cold digestion step: 4°C partial digestion first  
3. More frequent microscopy checks: Every 10-15 minutes
4. Enhanced debris removal: DNase + debris removal kit
5. Stop digestion as soon as clumps resolve (don't wait for timer)

MONITORING IMPROVEMENTS:
- Check cell release and viability every 15 minutes
- Take photos at each time point for documentation
- Count cells at intermediate steps to track yield

This experiment clearly shows the standard protocol needs modification for lung adenocarcinoma samples. The cellular composition bias toward immune cells is likely due to preferential survival during extended warm digestion.

=== NEXT STEPS ===

1. Literature review: Lung-specific scRNAseq protocols
2. Order reagents: Cold digestion enzymes, debris removal
3. Design exp_002: Optimized gentle dissociation protocol  
4. Consider collaboration: Reach out to groups with lung scRNAseq experience

End notes: 15:30 - Samples loaded into 10X, will have results in 48-72 hours for full analysis.
