- **2025-08-13T21:22:50.568439** - [analysis] Analyzed README.md: The file is a README markdown for “Experiment 001: Initial Protocol Test,” documenting a completed 10X scRNA‑seq run on a fresh primary lung adenocarcinoma specimen (patient LC‑001) that includes the experiment ID, date, operators, status, objective, sample details, and the exact dissociation protocol and key parameters used. It serves as a concise record of the experimental design, reagents, and conditions (e.g., 37 °C enzymatic digestion with the Miltenyi Tumor Dissociation Kit) for future reference and troubleshooting.
