## Research Question
I want to optimize the UDA-seq technology to increase its capture efficiency, currently this method only get ~1200 genes per cell on average, which is a bit low

## Hypothesis
I want to optimize the UDA-seq technology to increase its capture efficiency, currently this method only get ~1200 genes per cell on average, which is a bit low

## Planned Experiments
- test cell fixation protocol
- test
