# Experiment: 20250417

I’m ready to read the markdown files and draft the README, but I need to know which project (or repository) you’d like me to work within. Could you please select or specify the project that contains the `experiments/20250417/` folder? Once the project context is set, I can read the three markdown files and create the focused README you requested.
