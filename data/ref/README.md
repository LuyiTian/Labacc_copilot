This directory contains reference materials, protocols, and literature relevant to the project.

## Directory Structure

- `protocols/` - Standard operating procedures and experimental protocols
- `literature/` - Research papers, reviews, and external references
- Individual files for quick reference documents

## Protocols

Standard protocols should be stored in `protocols/` with descriptive names:

- `pcr_standard.md` - Standard PCR protocol
- `gel_electrophoresis.md` - Gel electrophoresis procedures  
- `cell_culture.md` - Cell culture maintenance protocols
- etc.

## Literature

Research papers and reviews should be organized in `literature/` by topic:

- `literature/protein_folding/` - Papers on protein folding
- `literature/enzyme_kinetics/` - Enzyme kinetics research
- `literature/optimization_methods/` - Experimental design and optimization
- etc.

## Quick References

- Add commonly used formulas, conversion factors, or troubleshooting guides directly to this directory
- Use descriptive filenames like `buffer_recipes.md`, `troubleshooting_common_issues.md`

## Maintenance

- Regularly update and organize references
- Remove outdated or irrelevant materials
- Add new protocols as they are developed or modified
- Link to specific references from experiment README files when used
