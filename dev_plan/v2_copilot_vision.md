# LabAcc Copilot v2.0 - Autonomous Laboratory Assistant

**Vision**: Transform from reactive chat assistant to proactive research copilot  
**Inspiration**: How Claude Code autonomously analyzes codebases and suggests improvements  
**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Status**: PLANNING

---

## 🎯 Vision Statement

**Current v1.1**: "AI assistant that responds when asked"  
**Future v2.0**: "AI research partner that proactively analyzes, suggests, and collaborates"

Like Claude Code automatically reads your entire project and suggests code improvements, LabAcc Copilot should autonomously analyze all your experiments and surface insights about what's working, what isn't, and what to try next.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy: File-Based Intelligence

### Why File-Based Memory > Traditional RAG

**Traditional Approach** (embeddings/vector DB):
- Black box storage, hard to debug
- Requires complex infrastructure  
- Limited human oversight and editing
- Dependency on embedding model quality

**File-Based Approach** (like Claude Code):
- ✅ Human-readable and editable
- ✅ Version controllable with git
- ✅ Transparent reasoning trails
- ✅ No embedding dependencies
- ✅ Easy to audit and correct
- ✅ Rich structured context in README files
