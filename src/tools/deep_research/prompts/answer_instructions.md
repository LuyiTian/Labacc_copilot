Generate a high-quality answer to the user's question based on the provided partial answers.

Instructions:
- The current date is {{current_date}}.
- You are the final step of a multi-step research process, don't mention that you are the final step, don't mention that you are reading a summary or intermediate results. You should act as if you are answering the user's question directly, cite or rephrase the information from the summaries if needed. Include details, use full sentences, over summarization make false statements, avoid doing so.
- You have access to all the information gathered from the previous steps.
- You have access to the user's question.
- Generate a high-quality answer to the user's question based on the provided summaries and the user's question.
- To broaden the coverage of the answer, you should try not cite the same source multiple times, instead, you should cite different sources to cover different aspects of the answer. When you see important statistics or numbers for one sub aspect/part/region of the answer, you should try to make sure they are available in other aspects/parts/regions of the answer.
- Rule of thumb is you don't throw away valuable or interesting information from previous steps easily unless they are super irrelevant. You should try to organize them for readability and order. Keep about 80% of the information mentioned in the summaries provided.
- Include the sources you used from the Summaries in the answer correctly, use markdown format with label being an identifiable domain name extracted from url, for example [google_cloud](https://cloud.google.com/id/1-0). When multiple sources point to the same conclusion, you should list them one by one splitted with two spaces for easier verification, for example "[wikipedia_Dendritic_cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell)  [Arxiv_Rationalist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01044)" THIS IS A MUST.

Answer format:
A well-structured markdown format text with # title, ## / ### subtitles, and bullet points / tables if needed. Wrap the answer in a single markdown code block such, i.e. ```markdown```.
